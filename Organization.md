Performance Engineering Body of Knowledge – The organization

Vision, Mission and Strategic plan

Our vision is to create an organization that will be the leading worldwide professional association for performance engineers and capacity planners. The mission is to develop and maintain standards for the practice of performance engineers and capacity planners. The long term goal is the certification of its practitioners.

The Strategic goals of our group are:

·Drive awareness of the value and contribution of the role of the performance engineer and capacity planner.

·Formalize and evolve the Guidebook to the SPE Body of Knowledge (PEBOK)

·Define a roadmap for professional growth and  development

·Advance the practices of PE/CP

·Provide forums for sharing knowledge

Governance and Operational goals

The PEBoK Organization is managed by a governing Steering committee, consisting of five to seven members that will set the yearly goals of the team. The Steering committee is a voting committee. The Steering committee will be active participants in leading, orchestrating and executing the activities each quarter. They will be responsible for reaching out the community to raise market awareness and to solicit volunteers to contribute towards a particular knowledge area with the PEBOK.

(Suggestion Peter:) The PEBoK organisation starts out as a working group of CMG (Computer Measurement Group).

The Steering committee meets formally every eight weeks to review progress on active and upcoming activities. The group will meet twice (spring/fall) a year to review overall progress, strategic goals, and the addition/subtraction of Directors.

The Steering committee will be supported by a group of Directors. The Directors are appointed by the steering committee, the directors duration is determined by the Steering committee. The Directors will help raise market awareness and will contribute towards a particular knowledge area.

The operational goals are to execute on the yearly roadmap the steering committee defines. Each Steering committee member will be responsible to sponsor and drive an operational activity.
